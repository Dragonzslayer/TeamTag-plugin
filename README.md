TeamTag-plugin
==============

The Bukkit TeamTag plugin project.

What this plugin is:
"TeamTag:
Snowball fights are fun. We all know that. Team-switch games like Bulldog & Tag are also fun. We all know that too. Yet, minecrafters have never combined those two nostalgic games in to one fun and easy minecraft game. Until now. Team tag is a 6v6 gamemode, where you are spawned with an inventory full of snowballs that kill in a 1 hit head-shot, 2 hit body-shot, and 3 hit limb-shot. But here's the twist. When you die, your team is automatically switched. So, if it is 6 blues vs 6 reds, but 2 reds die, then it will be 8 blues vs 4 reds - making staying alive and making "clutch plays" very important. Because of the super-fast pacing, games can end very quickly, making it the perfect gamemode to hop on and play for just a few minutes."
